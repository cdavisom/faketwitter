# Fake Twitter

This is practice, planning on comeback into web development and decided to rebember the django framework. Trying to emulate some twitter features.

Currently supports: tweet, retweet, likes and follows.

Build using python and django; bootstrap for the ui, since front is no longer my target stack.

30/12/2022 - Worked on this project for one week on spare time from work.

Its far from complete, plan to expand it in small packages.
